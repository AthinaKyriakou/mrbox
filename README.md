## About the Project
The analysis and processing of big data often requires combining remote and local platforms, services and 
cloud infrastructures. Due to the heterogeneity of these resources and the cost of transferring large-scale data, 
performing data-intensive tasks across them is typically a non-automated and laborious undertaking or requires the 
knowledge of specialized workflow tools by non-experts. 

The purpose of this application is to provide a **high-level and general picture** of the local and remote 
infrastructures, as well as to enable the user to **schedule**, **check locally**, **execute** and 
**remotely track operations** on data residing at any integrated platform. 

The application is structured according to the **filesystem hierarchy of the operating system** so that the monitoring 
will take place through seemingly local files and folders. The initial goal is to integrate **Hadoop** and **B2DROP** 
services and to be able to schedule **MapReduce jobs** with possibilities to expand to other platforms and types of 
data operations in the future.

### Features
The main features currently implemented are:

* Monitoring of the local /mrbox folder to track the creation, modification, deletion and relocation of its 
files and sub folders

* Integration of Hadoop and implementation of one way synchronization between the local /mrbox folder and the /mrbox 
folder of the remote HDFS

* Simple scheduling of Map Reduce jobs from the local file system to be executed in a remote HDFS 

* Automated fetching of Map Reduce jobs' outputs locally, after their completion remotely

* Implementation of the ```.link``` file type. When the output generated by a Map Reduce job is larger than the file 
size that can be stored locally, a ```.link``` file is created locally with a link to the remote HDFS. The link can be 
used in the browser to view the output in HDFS

* Integration of the B2DROP platform using the ownCloud Desktop Client.

### Built With
